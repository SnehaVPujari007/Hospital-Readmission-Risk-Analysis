# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Risk Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyses hospital readmission data to identify key risk factors contributing to patient readmissions. The objective is to apply data analytics and machine learning techniques to improve healthcare decision-making and support predictive risk modelling.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation.
